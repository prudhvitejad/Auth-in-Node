MVC(Model View Controller) pattern:
-----------------------------------
-> In MVC architecture/MVC pattern all the Model related files should be under 'models' folder, all the view related files should be under 'views' folder and all the action/controller related files should be under 'controllers' folder
-> All the configuration/connection-setup related files should be under 'helpers/config' folder
-> In the 'routes' folder, we should import the only related functions here and all the implementations/handler functions should be under the 'actions/controllers' folder
